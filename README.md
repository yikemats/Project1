# Tracking Elon Musk's Jet

This is a repository for my first project at [Lede Program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/). I collected the flight data for Elon Musk's primary jet, N628TS, using [OpenSky Network's API](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html). You can collect flight data such as departure/arrival airport and the time of the aircraft's first/last seen for a certain aircraft for a given period of time with this API.
